# Mathematics and Physics Reading
I will post solutions to exercsies/problems every once in a while for various readings in mathematics and physics. Below, find a list of books that I am or have worked through. Some books I have simply read, and others I have properly worked through a substantial amount of exercises. I also include a list of references that I recommend (or have been recommended to me but not yet read).

# Current Reading
* Szerkes P. - A Course in Modern Mathematical Physics
* Levin D., Peres Y., Wilmer E. - Markov Chains and Mixing Times, second edition
* Diaconis P. - Group Representations in Probability and Statistics
